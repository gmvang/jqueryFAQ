            <h2 class="open">How often to water my plant?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Providing your plant consistant water can create less stress for them but that doesn't nessarily mean to water them everyday. Each plant is unique and with it's own conditions in which it best thrives. Some plants prefer drying out a bit between waterings while some like their roots kept moist. Be sure to get to know your plant so you can properly care for them.</p>

            <h2 class="open">What to do with house plant pests?</h2>
            <p class="answer">You should always check the plant before you buy them. Pests can quickly spread to other house platns if not taken care of. If your plant has pests, it is best to isolate the plant as soon as possible for treatment. You can find pest sprays at your local garden store.</p>

            <h2 class="open">Is my house plant sick?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Plants in can be very sensitive. The slightest imbalance or soil, light, temperature, and watering can make a plant sick. Some things to look for are the leaves and soil. Is there white bits or moss growing on top of the soil? This usually is from over watering. Are the leaves brown or falling off? This is usually from the plant not receiving enough nutrients. If leaves are curling up , it could be a pest-caused sickness. Are there spots on the leaves? That is an indication the plant is getting too much sun. If the spots look black, that usually means a fungus infection.</p>

            <h2 class="open">Is my house plant dead or alive?</h2>
            <p class="answer">>Telling whether a plant is truly dead or alive can be a difficult task. There are subtle clues you can check for to help you make that judgement call. Has your plant lost all of it's leaves or all the leaves have gone brown? If yes, check and see if the stem of your plant is mushy or brittle. Also check the roots of the plant as and if they too are mushy and brittle then it is most likely your plant is dead.</p>
